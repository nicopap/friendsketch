The friendsketch backend and frontend.

Check [documentation] for details. The text files use the [zim-wiki] file format,
I encourage you download it and use it to navigate the documentation.

Check the `Makefile` and the docs for build instructions.

This project wasn't meant to be published, it is highly out-of-date and need a
strong (notably upgrade to elm 19 (if possible)) and a `cargo update` to bring
_very_ outdated dependencies up to date.

## TODO

The frontend currently doesn't build. Please be patient while I migrate to elm 19.
