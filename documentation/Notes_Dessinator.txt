====== Notes Dessinator ======
Created Tuesday 12 September 2017

This notebook relates to the Dessinator website game.
It is a collection of web-based games around drawing with multiple people over the web.

Some sections relates to the design and the choices behind it, other to the experiences learn from making the application, what where the roadblocks and what is to plan

[[+Create A room Page]]

[[+Pintclone game design]]

[[+Backend API specification]]

[[+market research]]

[[+Roadblocks & current issues]]

[[+Potential names]]

===== Dreams =====
* Handle explicitely user names in Main.hs.
	* Issue being that information is redundant.
	* This solves the problem of incoherent REST API calls for connecting to rooms.
* Implement test suite based on specification state machines / formally test the state machines

===== Current roadmap =====
* Mask room input in join page
* In join page, when changing name, put a confirmation button instead of automatically redirecting
* Add arbitrary color selector to the palette
* Rename "Round" to "drawing" in frontend to be consistent with the doc specs
* Start sketching a good interface layout.
* Improve how the backend handles stuff
	* Refactor RoomConnection (think hard about desing)
	* Sanitize names and roomids in backend
	* Implement game logic
	* Clean up when Rooms stay empty for too long
* Add tests to the backend
* Create A logging instance for the Websocket application.
* Fix chat
* Study Haskell websocket package to see if the following is possible:
	* Be aware of ping between server and client
	* Use this to slow down packet redistribution according to average ping.
	* Compute "real" guess time according to ping  so it is fair to everyone.
