> Concider using assayer crate for validation
> concider accepting an RC in GameMsg send channel as to avoid copying data
> Concider moving game logic in its own module
> Figure out how to URL-decode URLs so as to avoid surprises with %20 and / **(IMPORTANT)**
	> Do that in the client as well as the server
	> Manage malformed URLs in server properly


===== Current roadmap =====
* Make sure client handles properly joining in middle of Drawing & leaving artist
* In join page, when changing name, put a confirmation button instead of automatically redirecting
* Improve how the backend handles stuff
	* Sanitize names and roomids in backend
	* Implement game logic
	* Clean up when Rooms stay empty for too long
* Update API (Lobby master [bool â†’ name]) so lobby broadcasting is independent of the connected it is sending to.
* Implement "cooldown" on people leaving so they have a chance to rejoin.
* Add tests to the backend
* Fix chat
	* Frontend: create interface (for chat, and word to guess etc)
	* Backend: handle guesses and stuff, implement "SendTo"
