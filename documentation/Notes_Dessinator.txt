> Concider using assayer crate for validation
> concider accepting an RC in GameMsg send channel as to avoid copying data
> Concider moving game logic in its own module
> Figure out how to URL-decode URLs so as to avoid surprises with %20 and / **(IMPORTANT)**
	> Do that in the client, for names containing '/'
	> Test server for how it handles it
> Examine how to manage malformed request messages in warp (better handling of Conversion from body to API values)
> Better Error management with warp::Rejection and custom errors https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/blob/master/examples/errors.rs



===== Current roadmap =====
* Make sure client handles properly joining in middle of Drawing & leaving artist
* Improve how the backend handles stuff
	* Sanitize names and roomids in backend
	* Implement game logic
	* Clean up when Rooms stay empty for too long
* Implement "cooldown" on people leaving so they have a chance to rejoin.
* Add tests
* Improve client layout: room name field etc.
* Fix chat
	* Frontend: create interface (for chat, and word to guess etc)
	* Backend: handle guesses and stuff, implement "SendTo"
