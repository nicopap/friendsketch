====== Backend leave handling ======
Created Thursday 07 February 2019

* There is a **single source of Leaves messages** and it's the closures in ''ConnectionManager::join'' that adapt the websocket incoming messages
* ''oversee'' must make sure to react to those messages and remove the concerned sockets from the connections list.
* ''oversee'' must also notify the game of it
* The game must not send requests to communicate with a dropped connection, because it is interpreted as a **inconsistency** and force termination of the game.
