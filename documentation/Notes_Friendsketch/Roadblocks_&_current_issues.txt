====== Roadblocks & current issues ======
Created Tuesday 26 September 2017

===== Game =====

* Think about how to introduce ''-'' and spaces in guess word
* Do not relay messages from anyone containing word to guess

==== Client ====

* Use unified font, for better cross browser aspect

==== Server ====

* Create special structure to hold names to guess, implement management of words lists etc
	* related to: take random character from UTF string, display non-letter characters, 
* Borrow problem with names (same as with the chat messages)


===== Game Event Log =====

* A lot of string copies? What to do?
	* Provide to ''game'' a way to convert ''api::GameMsg'' into serialized form and keep track of it:
	* Have a ''struct SerializedVisibleEvent(Vec<u8>)'' that can only be constructed by serializing a ''VisibleEvent'' 
	* Have a ''Into<SerializedVisibleEvent>'' trait and implement it for ''VisibleEvent'', then espect ''Game'' to return ''Into<SerializedVisibleEvent>'' . Have ''Game::serializeMsg(api::VisibleEvent) -> SerializedVisibleEvent bb'' that is callable by the ''Game'' to serialize game messages and return them later for consuption

===== Custom color picker =====
I can't seem to get it to work :/
{{{code: lang="css" linenumbers="True"
.empty.colorbox::before {
	position: relative;
	content: "+";
	color: grey;
	font-size: 30px;
	font-weight: bold;
	height: 30px;
	top: -17px;
	width:30px;
	display: inline;
	z-index: 4;
	left: -8px;
}
}}}


===== API =====

* (very long term) "bundle" strokes into lines, as to avoid sending too many small data packets
* Think about how to setup settings such as:
	* Round count
	* Round length
