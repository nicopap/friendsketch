====== Roadblocks & current issues ======
Created Tuesday 26 September 2017

===== Chat =====

* Make sure that client's own messages are displayed in order:
	* When input is submitted, put it into message list as a "ghost"
	* When server sends back own message, remove "ghost" message
* Feedback on wrong message, server messages
* Implement chat messages for ''ClassicMsg'' messages

===== Game abort screen =====

* When 1 player remaining, what to do?
	* Tell them they can either wait for more players or quit, show them the room id

===== Game =====

* disable drawing control for ''Spectator''
* Think about how to introduce ''-'' and spaces in guess word
* Implement "between round state" before ''start'' and after ''over'' 
* Add score changes to ''Room'' and all the ravioli
* Think of what to do when artist leaves
* Tick down the clock on frontend
* Do not relay messages from artist containing word to guess

===== Design Issue =====

How to handle periodic updates sent by server?
* Send "end round" messages
* Send "Reveal" messages
* Wait before resending "StartRound" message

===== Game Event Log =====

* A lot of string copies? What to do?
	* Replace ''Name'' in game log by Id, avoids extra allocation, but still copies at ''sync'' .


===== API =====

* (very long term) "bundle" strokes into lines, as to avoid sending too many small data packets
