====== Roadblocks & current issues ======
Created Tuesday 26 September 2017

===== Game =====

* Think about how to introduce ''-'' and spaces in guess word
* Do not relay messages from anyone containing word to guess

==== Client ====

* **Pointer events do not work under webkit**, add polyfill or similar
	* https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm-pep
	* Investigate why touch-based dragging doesn't work

* Use unified font, for better cross browser aspect
* Highlight leading score players
* Investigate why frontend closes, then reconnects and finally closes when closing a websocket.

* gameplay
	* Display word category
	* display current round and estimated total rounds (for exemple at round result screen and in round start message)

==== Server ====

* Enable runtime update of decks
* Words
	* show non-letter chars
	* more leaniant comparison between word and guess
	* Test random words sequence (non-duplicate, panic-freeness, etc)

===== Game Event Log =====

* A lot of string copies? What to do?
	* Use references to names instead of owned names

===== Custom color picker =====
I can't seem to get it to work :/
'''
.empty.colorbox::before {
	position: relative;
	content: "+";
	color: grey;
	font-size: 30px;
	font-weight: bold;
	height: 30px;
	top: -17px;
	width:30px;
	display: inline;
	z-index: 4;
	left: -8px;
}
'''


===== API =====

* (very long term) "bundle" strokes into lines, as to avoid sending too many small data packets
