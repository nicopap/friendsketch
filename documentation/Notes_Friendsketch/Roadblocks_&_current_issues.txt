====== Roadblocks & current issues ======
Created Tuesday 26 September 2017

===== Game =====

* Think about how to introduce ''-'' and spaces in guess word
* Do not relay messages from anyone containing word to guess

==== Client ====

* Use unified font, for better cross browser aspect
* Highlight leading score players
* Display current round and total round somewhere (starting to draw message + round result)
* Investigate why frontend closes, then reconnects and finally closes when closing a websocket.

==== Server ====

* Create special structure to hold words to guess, implement management of words lists etc
	* related to: take random character from UTF string, display non-letter characters,

===== Game Event Log =====

* A lot of string copies? What to do?
	* Use references to names instead of owned names

===== Custom color picker =====
I can't seem to get it to work :/

	font-weight: bold;
	height: 30px;
	top: -17px;
	width:30px;
	display: inline;
	z-index: 4;
	left: -8px;
}

===== API =====

* (very long term) "bundle" strokes into lines, as to avoid sending too many small data packets
