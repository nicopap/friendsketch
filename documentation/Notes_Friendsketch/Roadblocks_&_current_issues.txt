====== Roadblocks & current issues ======
Created Tuesday 26 September 2017

===== Chat =====

* Feedback on wrong message, server messages
* Remove ''Ghost'' for messages that are not sent back (like successful guesses)
* Implement chat messages for ''ClassicMsg'' messages

===== Game =====

* disable drawing control for ''Spectator''
* Think about how to introduce ''-'' and spaces in guess word
* FRONTEND: Implement "between round state" before ''start'' and after ''over'' 
* Add score changes to ''Room'' and all the ravioli
* Tick down the clock on frontend
* Do not relay messages from artist containing word to guess

==== Server ====
* Create special structure to hold names to guess, implement management of words lists etc
	* related to: take random character from UTF string, display non-letter characters, 
* Better management of players:
	* Each player have a different internal state, game server needs to keep track of that


===== Game Event Log =====

* A lot of string copies? What to do?
	* Replace ''Name'' in game log by Id, avoids extra allocation, but still copies at ''sync'' .

===== Custom color picker =====
I can't seem to get it to work :/
{{{code: lang="css" linenumbers="True"
.empty.colorbox::before {
	position: relative;
	content: "+";
	color: grey;
	font-size: 30px;
	font-weight: bold;
	height: 30px;
	top: -17px;
	width:30px;
	display: inline;
	z-index: 4;
	left: -8px;
}
}}}


===== API =====

* (very long term) "bundle" strokes into lines, as to avoid sending too many small data packets
* Think about how to setup settings such as:
	* Round count
	* Round length
