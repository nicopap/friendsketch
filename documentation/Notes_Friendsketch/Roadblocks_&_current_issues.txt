Created Tuesday 26 September 2017

===== Chat =====

* Make sure that client's own messages are displayed in order:
	* When input is submitted, put it into message list as a "ghost"
	* When server sends back own message, remove "ghost" message
* Feedback on wrong message, server messages

===== Game abort screen =====

* When 1 player remaining, what to do?
	* Tell them they can either wait for more players or quit, show them the room id

===== Game =====

* block drawing control for ''Spectator''

===== Game Event Log =====

* A lot of string copies? What to do?
	* Replace ''Name'' in game log by Id, avoids extra allocation, but still copies at ''sync'' .


===== API =====

* (very long term) "bundle" strokes into lines, as to avoid sending too many small data packets
