====== Joining a game ======
Created Monday 04 February 2019

===== Unique join pages =====

The ''create'' page shall only let someone create a game. A different page will be used for joins. Why?:
* The game creator will have access to a link that he can share with people he wants only.
	* A link is more convinient to use than a page where you have to enter a specific keyword and click on the right button
	* The server can redirect to a one-use URL so that what is shown in the address bar can't be used to join a game

It has only a field to choose your name (design from ''create'' page apply here), and button to submit.
* Future: show game settings, message from room leader (may be difficult, if settings can be changed in-game).

 ''join/RoomId'' : The link to game room visible to user ''join/*/uuid'' : The url to the unique use join lobby

===== Unique connection uri =====

* one ''/ws/connId'' per player in a room
* The ''connId'' random value persisted in server until room is closed, .
