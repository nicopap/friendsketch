Created Tuesday 12 September 2017

This notebook relates to the Friendsketch website game.
It is a collection of web-based games around drawing with multiple people over the web.

Some sections relates to the design and the choices behind it, other to the experiences learn from making the application, what where the roadblocks and what is to plan

[[+Roadblocks & current issues]]

[[+Devlog]]

> Concider using assayer crate for validation
> concider accepting an RC in GameMsg send channel as to avoid copying data
> Figure out how to URL-decode URLs so as to avoid surprises with %20 and / **(IMPORTANT)**
	> Do that in the client, for names containing '/'
	> Test server for how it handles it
	> Concider leaking the ''Id'' of the player through API. This way, the server controls the URL the player has to visit, instead of the user.
> Examine how to manage malformed request messages in warp (better handling of Conversion from body to API values)
> Better Error management with warp::Rejection and custom errors https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/blob/master/examples/errors.rs

> Investigate error "unreachable code has been reached" that happens after a while
> Investigate how to garbage-collect empty rooms that result from a broken disconnection

> Concider having a simpler way to get someone to join game (for exemple with URL)
