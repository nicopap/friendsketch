> Figure out how to URL-decode URLs so as to avoid surprises with %20 and / **(IMPORTANT)**
	> Do that in the client, for names containing '/'
	> Test server for how it handles it
> Examine how to manage malformed request messages in warp (better handling of Conversion from body to API values)

> Concider having a simpler way to get someone to join game (for exemple with URL)

> Possible optimisation: serialize ''GameEvent'' when adding them to game log

===== Current roadmap =====
* Improve how the backend handles stuff
* Add tests
* Better random words
