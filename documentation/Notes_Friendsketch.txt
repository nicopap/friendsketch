[[+Roadblocks & current issues]]

[[+Devlog]]

> Concider using assayer crate for validation
> Figure out how to URL-decode URLs so as to avoid surprises with %20 and / **(IMPORTANT)**
	> Do that in the client, for names containing '/'
	> Test server for how it handles it
	> Concider leaking the ''Id'' of the player through API. This way, the server controls the URL the player has to visit, instead of the user.
> Examine how to manage malformed request messages in warp (better handling of Conversion from body to API values)
> Investigate error "unreachable code has been reached" that happens after a while

> Concider having a simpler way to get someone to join game (for exemple with URL)
> Reset game state when player count down to 1
> Reimplement concept for unselected custom colors
> Refactor frontend pintclone.room

===== Current roadmap =====
* Improve how the backend handles stuff
	* Implement game logic
* Add tests
* Improve client layout: room name field etc.
* Improve chat
	* Frontend: create interface (for chat, and word to guess etc)
	* Backend: handle guesses and stuff,
