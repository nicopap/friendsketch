====== Create A room Page ======
Created Tuesday 12 September 2017

The page let the user create a room and gives him the necessary tools to customize, the party. It also helps him connect to his friends.

It should be very fast and barebone, so as to not confuse the newcomer.

* Any fancy options should be hidden behind small buttons, but once known about, should be ergonomic enough to understand by just looking at it.

* It should also be obvious that you can customize the rooms options

* The game room name should be hidden (attribute password) in the join lobby (yeah amazing)

* User should have the choice between showing teh code or copying in clipboard.

* A room name is a random string generated by the server to identify and authenticate users that want to connect to each other. A user get the room name by creating a Room (presses the Create new Game button)

* The user should be shown the room name IF AND ONLY IF other users can join using the joining lobby in the current state.

* A user can join an existing room by inserting the room name in the Joining lobby.
	* The user has feedback about the status of his connection, States that must be taken in consideration:
	* The room name entered is yet not full.
	* The user entered a room name but he still do not have feedback about the validity of his room
	* The user entered the room name, but it is invalid
	* Room exists but the game didn't start yet (In this case, users list is displayed)
	* Valid room name, but the connection is not yet complete.

===== Connection handling =====

The first two/three operations are pure REST post calls:
* Creating room/ setting up settigns
* Entering the Join-room lobby

Lobby & new player joining should be handled by the game itself.
