Feedback should be subtily given to the user about what action they should take

Canvas has three states, let's reflect the state in the UI:
* Pregame: have a backgroud with text saying "Waiting to start a new round, this drawing is for your eyes only"
* Artist: If the canvas is empty, have text saying "it is your turn to draw". have a blank background if the artist started drawing.
* Spectator: have the toolbox greyed-out to show that they cannot draw, have the name of the artist in the userlist highlighted to show who is drawing.

The user list is always in the order of who is going to draw, from top to bottom.

The name of the current user is highlighted by being underlined (''text-decoration: underline'' in CSS)

The name of the current leader is highlighted in yellow, follow-ups are a thiner gold.

Each cell of the user list contains information about what has happend since the beginning of the game, and hints at what is going to happen next.
* A case for each round there is in the game
* Have the number of points earned at a round for rounds that already happend
	* If the person was an artist for the given round, the case is of the color that highlights an artist.
	* If no points were earned, there is a red X
* Somewhere display the total of points earne
